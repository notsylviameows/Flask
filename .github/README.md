  |~|     Flask: a minigame plugin library

**NOTICE:** This plugin/library is currently under development, and is not ready to be used. 
When this project is in a more ready state, this notice will be removed and proper documentation will be created.

## What is this?
Flask is an open-source library plugin meant to ease the development process of minigames for Paper servers. Currently, it only supports usage on a single server, and not a network.

### Goals
These are features that I would like to implement at some point, but have no set plans to yet.
- Implement a parties system to allow players to queue into a game with their friends.
- Allow support for networks and using dedicated server instances to host a lobby.
- Implement database/other world loader support.
- Lobby gadgets, tokens, and/or shops.
- Central statistics hub, making it easier for minigames to track statistics without worrying about all the saving stuff.

### Dependencies
- `AdvancedSlimePaper` ([GitHub](https://github.com/InfernalSuite/AdvancedSlimePaper)): allows minigames to spin up world instances nearly instantly without worrying about the major performance a vanilla world would cause.
